<h1>‘A GREENER FUTURE’</h1>
<p>Will Banks' Funding of Fossil Fuel directly effect CO2 Emmission? and Will Decrease funding in fossil fuel increase bank performance?</p>

<div class="wrap">
    <a class="textLink" href="homepage.html"> Bring Me Back: HOME </a>


<h2> Aim: Due to probability over perceived risk, banks’ massive investing and funding of Fossil Fuel makes them the biggest contribution to climate change. Environmental, social and governance issue then had been formed and investigate more heavily due to the index being a part of their reputation. 
    Due to Barclays and HBCS being the largest contributors in the UK financing fossil fuel( <a class="textLink" href=" https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-27/banks-produce-700-times-more-emissions-from-loans-than-offices?leadSource=uverify%20wall"> Marsh </a>,2021) this project aims to discuss on whether a decrease in funding fossil fuel intervene with their banking performances. 
    </h2>

<h4> How much are top Banks funding Fossil Fuel Companies?</h4>
<div class="chart" id="ChartA"></div>
<p>This graph indicates top 10 banks by ranking, “10” being the most invested in fossil fuel and “0” being the least. As we can see, Barclays and HSBC funded a total of 15 out of 16 oil and gas companies with the minimum amount of funding to be around 400million USD to 3050million USD in a total of 6 years. 

    Challenges: the information was hard to find and gathered, along with the naming of Banks being different which I had to change manually in Excel. However, the information of the graph is already in a <a class="" href="Banks and thier fossilfuel investors .csv"> CSV</a>format fromFor this chart,  the datas needed was provided by <a class="textLink" href="https://www.bankingonclimatechaos.org">Banking On Climate Chaos</a>  in  their 2022 Fossil Fuel Report</p>
     </p>


<h4> Is the decrease in Corbon Emission in the UK related to Banks?</h4>
<div class="chart" id="ChartB"></div>
<P>link to <a class="textLink" href="uk-emissions project.csv"> CSV </a> file</P>
<p>The above Graph shows a constant decrease in UK’s Co2 emission. As the UK prime minister had brought up the goal of being net zero by 2050 which urged banks to change their investment and funding strategies. Alongside with ESG index, the banking industry is now planning for a “Greener Future”. The question is, are UK Banks willing to make a change? </p>


<p>HSBC bank and Barclays bank were actively investing and funding Fossil Fuel up until the year 2021 according to <a class="textLink" href="https://www.banktrack.org/download/barclays_and_hsbc_s_43_billion_fossil_fuel_problem">Bank Track</a> (2021).
<div class="chart" id="ChartC"></div>
<div class="chart" id="ChartD"></div>
<P>link to <a class="textLink" href="funding.csv"> CSV </a> file</P>
<p>Comparing the funding of fosiil fuel on 2016 and 2021, we could see that Barclays had a decrease of 5133millions of funding while HSBC shows an increase of 2073million</p>
<p>Hence to conclude this section, banks Funding of Fossil Fuel companies can indirectly effect CO2 emission however, there are many more a country can contribute in order to see the results seen in the second graph above such as government regulations to the Fossil Fuel Companies. </p>

<h4> How is Banks' ROE correlated by the Funding of Fossil Fuel as a whole in the EU?  </h4>
<div class="chart" id="ChartE"></div>
<p>This graph shows the correlation between Bank's ROE in the EU and their, using data in 2020
    We can see positive correlation between ROE which is the performance of the bank in 2020 and the country's funding of fossil fuel , with a R2 of 0.02.
    </p>
    <p>The challenging part of this is that it is hard to find individual ROE of banks hence I dicided to use a different approch in analysing the regression</p>

    <h4> More on Banks Preformances and Their Relation to Fossil Fuel Investing </h4>
<p>Both set of figures explain Banks performance in two sectors, first in customer gains and loss to the funding of fossil fuel. Secondly, Bank’s financing on fossil fuel on market capital of banks.  </p>
<p>
    <div class="chart" id="ChartF"></div>

<p><a class="textLink" href="Week9merge.ipynb"> colab </a></p>
<p>Up until 2021, Bank’s ethical company index does not determine the size of the back. As seen, Barclays and HSBC had the most numbers of customers by having non appealing index scores such as 8 and 13 respectively, while also being top contributor to the fossil fuel industry.  </p>


<h4> To Conclude</h4>
<p>To Conclude, banks do play a role in the increase of CO2 emission in an indirect way by financing the Fossil Fuel Companies. However, due to the implementation of ESG, we hope that Banks who are large in Capital which has larger impact on the environment and the economy could decrease in funding Fossil Fuels. Moreover, consumers and government policies contributes to the improvement of the use of Fossil Fuel as well. All this said, we also should not let our guard down as Greenwashing is another popular topic we would be able to discuss soon. </p>
